Cost	1
up	1
to	1
$37	1

would	1
be	1
financed	1
by	1

where	1

since	1

set	1
up	1

that	1

topics	1
as	1

be	1
discussed	1
in	1

out	1

On	1
the	1
negative	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
balance	1
sheet	1
must	1
be	1
set	1
some	1
disappointment	1
that	1
the	1
United	1

leadership	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
as	1
much	1
in	1
evidence	1
as	1
hoped	1
for	1

One	1
diplomat	1
described	1
the	1
tenor	1
of	1
Secretary	1
of	1
State	1
Dean	1
Rusk's	1
speeches	1
as	1
``	1
inconclusive	1
''	1
.	1
But	1
he	1
hastened	1
to	1
add	1
that	1
,	1
if	1
United	1
States	1
policies	1
were	1
not	1
always	1
clear	1
,	1
despite	1
Mr.	1
Rusk's	1
analysis	1
of	1
the	1
various	1
global	1
danger	1
points	1
and	1
setbacks	1
for	1
the	1
West	1
,	1
this	1
may	1
merely	1
mean	1
the	1
new	1
administration	1
has	1
not	1
yet	1
firmly	1
fixed	1
its	1
policy	1
.	1
Exploratory	1
mood	1
A	1
certain	1
vagueness	1
may	1
also	1
be	1
caused	1
by	1
tactical	1
appreciation	1
of	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
present	1
council	1
meeting	1
is	1
a	1
semipublic	1
affair	1
,	1
with	1
no	1
fewer	1
than	1
six	1
Soviet	1
correspondents	1
accredited	1
.	1
The	1
impression	1
has	1
nevertheless	1
been	1
given	1
during	1
these	1
three	1
days	1
,	1
despite	1
Mr.	1
Rusk's	1
personal	1
popularity	1
,	1
that	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
delegation	1
came	1
to	1
Oslo	1
in	1
a	1
somewhat	1
tentative	1
and	1
exploratory	1
frame	1
of	1
mind	1
,	1
more	1
ready	1
to	1
listen	1
and	1
learn	1
than	1
to	1
enunciate	1
firm	1
policy	1
on	1
a	1
global	1
scale	1
with	1
detailed	1
application	1
to	1
individual	1
danger	1
spots	1
.	1
The	1
Secretary	1
of	1
State	1
himself	1
,	1
in	1
his	1
first	1
speech	1
,	1
gave	1
some	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
tremendous	1
march	1
of	1
events	1
inside	1
and	1
outside	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
that	1
has	1
preoccupied	1
the	1
new	1
administration	1
in	1
the	1
past	1
four	1
months	1
.	1
But	1
where	1
the	1
core	1
of	1
NATO	1
is	1
concerned	1
,	1
the	1
Secretary	1
of	1
State	1
has	1
not	1
only	1
reiterated	1
the	1
United	1
States'	1
profound	1
attachment	1
to	1
the	1
alliance	1
,	1
``	1
cornerstone	1
''	1
of	1
its	1
foreign	1
policy	1
,	1
but	1
has	1
announced	1
that	1
five	1
nuclear	1
submarines	1
will	1
eventually	1
be	1
at	1
NATO's	1
disposal	1
in	1
European	1
waters	1
.	1
The	1
Secretary	1
of	1
State	1
has	1
also	1
solemnly	1
repeated	1
a	1
warning	1
to	1
the	1
Soviet	1
Union	1
that	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
will	1
not	1
stand	1
for	1
another	1
setback	1
in	1
Berlin	1
,	1
an	1
affirmation	1
once	1
again	1
taken	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
council	1
as	1
a	1
whole	1
.	1
Conflict	1
surveyed	1
The	1
secretary's	1
greatest	1
achievement	1
is	1
perhaps	1
the	1
rekindling	1
of	1
NATO	1
realization	1
that	1
East-West	1
friction	1
,	1
wherever	1
it	1
take	1
place	1
around	1
the	1
globe	1
,	1
is	1
in	1
essence	1
the	1
general	1
conflict	1
between	1
two	1
entirely	1
different	1
societies	1
,	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
treated	1
as	1
such	1
without	1
regard	1
to	1
geographical	1
distance	1
or	1
lack	1
of	1
apparent	1
connection	1
.	1
The	1
annual	1
spring	1
meeting	1
has	1
given	1
an	1
impetus	1
in	1
three	1
main	1
directions	1
:	1
more	1
,	1
deeper	1
,	1
and	1
more	1
timely	1
political	1
consultation	1
within	1
the	1
alliance	1
,	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
Organization	1
for	1
Economic	1
Cooperation	1
and	1
Development	1
(	1
when	1
ratified	1
)	1
as	1
a	1
method	1
of	1
coordinating	1
aid	1
to	1
the	1
underdeveloped	1
countries	1
,	1
and	1
the	1
need	1
for	1
strengthening	1
conventional	1
forces	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
maintenance	1
of	1
the	1
nuclear	1
deterrent	1
.	1
This	1
increase	1
in	1
the	1
``	1
threshold	1
''	1
,	1
as	1
the	1
conventional	1
forces	1
strengthening	1
is	1
called	1
,	1
will	1
prove	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
alliance's	1
most	1
difficult	1
problems	1
in	1
the	1
months	1
to	1
come	1

Each	1
ally	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
obligations	1
long	1
since	1
laid	1
down	1
,	1
but	1
never	1
completely	1
fulfilled	1

The	1
Kennedy	1
administration	1
moves	1
haltingly	1
toward	1
a	1
Geneva	1
conference	1
on	1
Laos	1

as	1
serious	1
debate	1
over	1
its	1
foreign	1
policy	1
erupts	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
.	1
There	1
is	1
little	1
optimism	1
here	1
that	1
the	1
Communists	1
will	1
be	1
any	1
more	1
docile	1
at	1
the	1
conference	1
table	1

they	1
were	1
in	1

mainly	1
interested	1
in	1
setting	1
up	1
an	1
international	1
inspection	1
system	1
which	1
will	1
prevent	1
Laos	1
from	1
being	1
used	1
as	1
a	1
base	1
for	1
Communist	1
attacks	1
on	1
neighboring	1
Thailand	1

South	1
Viet	1

count	1
on	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
the	1
neutral	1
countries	1
attending	1
the	1
Geneva	1
conference	1
to	1
achieve	1
this	1

The	1
United	1

hopes	1
that	1
any	1
future	1
Lao	1
Cabinet	1
would	1
not	1
become	1
Communist	1
dominated	1
.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
apparent	1
that	1
no	1
acceptable	1
formula	1
has	1
been	1
found	1
to	1
prevent	1
such	1
a	1
possibility	1
.	1
Policies	1
modified	1
The	1
inclination	1
here	1
is	1
to	1
accept	1
a	1
de	1
facto	1
cease-fire	1
in	1
Laos	1
,	1
rather	1
than	1
continue	1
to	1
insist	1
on	1
a	1
verification	1
of	1
the	1
cease-fire	1
by	1
the	1
international	1
control	1
commission	1
before	1
participating	1
in	1
the	1
Geneva	1
conference	1
.	1
This	1
is	1
another	1
of	1
the	1
modifications	1
of	1
policy	1
on	1
Laos	1
that	1
the	1
Kennedy	1
administration	1
has	1
felt	1
compelled	1
to	1
make	1
.	1
It	1
excuses	1
these	1
actions	1
as	1
being	1
the	1
chain	1
reaction	1
to	1
basic	1
errors	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
previous	1
administration	1

spokesmen	1
insist	1
that	1
there	1

One	1
Republican	1

told	1
this	1
correspondent	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
constantly	1
being	1
asked	1
why	1
he	1
didn't	1
attack	1
the	1
Kennedy	1
administration	1
on	1
this	1
score	1

His	1
reply	1

he	1
said	1

was	1
that	1
he	1
agreed	1
to	1
the	1
need	1
for	1
unity	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
now	1

But	1
he	1
further	1
said	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
better	1
politics	1
to	1
let	1
others	1
question	1

The	1

served	1
notice	1
through	1
Senator	1

of	1
Kentucky	1
,	1
chairman	1
of	1
the	1
Republican	1
National	1
Committee	1
,	1
that	1
the	1
Kennedy	1
administration	1
would	1
be	1
held	1
responsible	1
if	1
the	1
outcome	1
in	1
Laos	1
was	1
a	1
coalition	1
government	1
susceptible	1
of	1
Communist	1
domination	1

Kennedy	1

This	1
group	1
pleads	1
with	1
the	1

to	1
``	1

Mr.	1
Nixon	1
,	1
for	1
his	1
part	1
,	1
would	1
oppose	1
intervention	1
in	1
Cuba	1
without	1
specific	1
provocation	1
.	1
But	1
he	1
did	1
recommend	1
that	1
President	1
Kennedy	1
state	1
clearly	1
that	1
if	1
Communist	1
countries	1
shipped	1
any	1
further	1
arms	1
to	1
Cuba	1

it	1
would	1
not	1

the	1
Cuban	1
fiasco	1
and	1
the	1
Communist	1
military	1
victories	1
in	1
Laos	1
,	1
almost	1
any	1
observer	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
that	1

blended	1

early	1
in	1
his	1
administration	1
he	1
informed	1
the	1
Kremlin	1
through	1
diplomatic	1
channels	1
,	1
a	1
high	1
official	1
source	1
disclosed	1
,	1
that	1
the	1
new	1
administration	1
would	1
react	1
even	1
tougher	1
than	1
the	1
Eisenhower	1
administration	1
would	1
during	1
the	1
formative	1
period	1
of	1
the	1
administration	1
.	1
Strenuous	1
efforts	1
were	1
made	1
to	1
remove	1
pin	1
pricking	1
from	1
administration	1
statements	1
.	1
Policies	1
on	1
nuclear	1
test	1

were	1
reviewed	1
and	1
changed	1

But	1
thus	1
far	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
no	1
response	1
in	1
kind	1
.	1
Foreign	1
aid	1
programs	1
were	1
revamped	1
to	1
give	1
greater	1
emphasis	1
to	1
economic	1

and	1
to	1
encourage	1
political	1
reform	1
in	1

In	1
Laos	1
,	1
the	1
administration	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
Eisenhower	1
administration	1
efforts	1
to	1
show	1
determination	1
by	1
sailing	1
a	1
naval	1
fleet	1
into	1
Southeast	1
Asian	1
waters	1
as	1
a	1
useless	1
gesture	1
.	1
Again	1
and	1
again	1
it	1
asked	1
the	1
Communists	1
to	1
``	1
freeze	1
''	1
the	1
military	1
situation	1
in	1
Laos	1
.	1
But	1
the	1
Communists	1
aided	1
the	1
Pathet	1
Lao	1
at	1
an	1
even	1
faster	1
rate	1
.	1
And	1
after	1
several	1
correspondents	1
went	1
into	1
Pathet	1
Lao	1
territory	1
and	1
exposed	1
the	1
huge	1
build-up	1
,	1
administration	1
spokesmen	1
acclaimed	1
them	1
for	1
performing	1
a	1
``	1
great	1
service	1

and	1
laid	1
the	1
matter	1
before	1

SEATO	1
was	1
steamed	1
up	1
and	1
prepared	1
contingency	1
plans	1
for	1
coping	1
with	1
the	1
military	1
losses	1
in	1
Laos	1
.	1
But	1
the	1
Communists	1
never	1
gave	1
sufficient	1
provocation	1
at	1
any	1
one	1
time	1
for	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
to	1
want	1
to	1
risk	1
a	1
limited	1
or	1
an	1
all-out	1
war	1
over	1
Laos	1
.	1
(	1
Some	1
SEATO	1
nations	1
disagreed	1
,	1
however	1
.	1
)	1
There	1
was	1
the	1
further	1
complication	1
that	1
the	1
administration	1
had	1
very	1
early	1
concluded	1
that	1
Laos	1
was	1
ill	1
suited	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
ally	1
,	1
unlike	1
its	1
more	1
determined	1
neighbors	1
,	1
Thailand	1
and	1
South	1
Viet	1
Nam	1
.	1
The	1
administration	1
declared	1
itself	1
in	1
favor	1
of	1
a	1
neutralized	1
Laos	1
.	1
The	1
pro-Western	1
government	1
,	1
which	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
had	1
helped	1
in	1
a	1
revolt	1
against	1
the	1
Souvanna	1
Phouma	1
``	1
neutralist	1
''	1
government	1
,	1
never	1
did	1
appear	1
to	1
spark	1
much	1
fighting	1
spirit	1
in	1
the	1
Royal	1
Lao	1
Army	1
.	1
There	1
certainly	1
was	1
not	1
any	1
more	1
energy	1
displayed	1
after	1
it	1
was	1
clear	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
would	1
not	1
back	1
the	1
pro-Western	1
government	1
to	1
the	1
hilt	1
.	1
If	1
the	1
administration	1
ever	1
had	1
any	1
ideas	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
find	1
an	1
acceptable	1
alternative	1
to	1
Prince	1
Souvanna	1
Phouma	1
,	1
whom	1
it	1
felt	1
was	1
too	1
trusting	1
of	1
Communists	1
,	1
it	1
gradually	1
had	1
to	1
relinquish	1
them	1
.	1
One	1
factor	1
was	1
the	1
statement	1
of	1
Senator	1
J.	1
W.	1
Fulbright	1
(	1
D	1
)	1
of	1
Arkansas	1
,	1
chairman	1
of	1
the	1
Senate	1
Foreign	1
Relations	1
Committee	1
.	1
He	1
declared	1
on	1
March	1
25	1
that	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
had	1
erred	1
a	1
year	1
and	1
a	1
half	1

by	1
``	1

to	1
check	1
the	1
rapid	1
growth	1
of	1
juvenile	1
delinquency	1
in	1
the	1
United	1
States	1
.	1
The	1
President	1
is	1
deeply	1
concerned	1
over	1
this	1
problem	1
and	1
its	1
effect	1
upon	1
the	1
``	1
vitality	1
of	1
the	1
nation	1
''	1
.	1
In	1
an	1
important	1
assertion	1
of	1
national	1
leadership	1
in	1
this	1
field	1
,	1
he	1
has	1
issued	1

by	1
a	1
Citizens	1
Advisory	1
Council	1
of	1
recognized	1
authorities	1
on	1
juvenile	1
problems	1
.	1
The	1
President	1
asks	1
the	1
support	1
and	1
cooperation	1
of	1
Congress	1
in	1
his	1
efforts	1
through	1
the	1
enactment	1
of	1
legislation	1
to	1
provide	1
federal	1
grants	1
to	1
states	1
for	1
specified	1
efforts	1
in	1
combating	1
this	1
disturbing	1
crime	1
trend	1
.	1
Offenses	1

The	1
President	1
has	1
also	1
called	1
upon	1
the	1
Attorney	1
General	1

the	1
Secretary	1
of	1
Health	1
,	1
Education	1
and	1
Welfare	1

.	1
His	1
sense	1
of	1
urgency	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
stems	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
court	1
cases	1

juvenile	1
arrests	1
have	1
more	1
than	1
doubled	1
since	1

Noting	1
that	1

handed	1
the	1
Defense	1

the	1
major	1
responsibility	1
for	1
the	1
nation's	1
civil	1
defense	1
program	1
,	1
Mr.	1
Hawksley	1
said	1
the	1
federal	1
government	1
would	1
pay	1
half	1
the	1
salary	1
of	1
a	1
full-time	1
local	1
director	1
.	1
He	1
expressed	1
the	1
opinion	1
the	1
city	1
could	1
hire	1
a	1
CD	1
director	1
for	1
about	1
$3,500	1
a	1
year	1
and	1
would	1
only	1
have	1
to	1

up	1
half	1

there	1
are	1
a	1
number	1
of	1

would	1
be	1
willing	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
full-time	1

said	1

Along	1
with	1
a	1
director	1

the	1
city	1
should	1
provide	1
a	1
CD	1
headquarters	1
so	1
that	1

information	1
about	1

advantage	1

would	1
come	1

having	1
a	1
full-time	1
director	1

that	1

apply	1
to	1

purchasing	1
equipment	1
needed	1
for	1
a	1
sound	1

Matching	1
funds	1
also	1
can	1
be	1
obtained	1
for	1
procurement	1
of	1
such	1
items	1
as	1
radios	1

sirens	1

rescue	1
trucks	1

said	1

Hawksley	1
believes	1
that	1
East	1

could	1
use	1
two	1
more	1
rescue	1
trucks	1

similar	1
to	1
the	1

obtained	1
several	1
years	1
ago	1

now	1
detailed	1
to	1
the	1
Central	1
Fire	1
Station	1

He	1
would	1
assign	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
rescue	1
trucks	1
to	1
the	1
Riverside	1
section	1
of	1
the	1
city	1

the	1
present	1
status	1
of	1
civil	1

Mr.	1

willing	1
to	1
bet	1
that	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
person	1

Mr.	1
Hawksley	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
critical	1
of	1

for	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1

do	1

where	1

vital	1
information	1

has	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
available	1
to	1
the	1
public	1
frequently	1

at	1
regular	1
intervals	1

Mr.	1
Hawksley	1
said	1

he	1
plans	1
to	1
call	1
a	1
meeting	1
early	1

Providence	1
at	1
its	1

plan	1
further	1
strategy	1

said	1
that	1

no	1
candidates	1
for	1

mind	1
at	1

that	1

endorse	1
candidates	1

the	1
time	1
comes	1

expected	1
in	1
coming	1

was	1
indicated	1
.	1
Misunderstanding	1
of	1
the	1
real	1
meaning	1
of	1
a	1
home	1
rule	1
charter	1
was	1
cited	1
as	1
a	1
factor	1
which	1
has	1
caused	1
the	1
Citizens	1

obtain	1
signatures	1
under	1
what	1
were	1
termed	1

up	1

reported	1

The	1
resentment	1
among	1
Democratic	1
organization	1

to	1
the	1
reported	1
Wagner	1
plan	1
was	1
directed	1

at	1

efforts	1
to	1
name	1
his	1
own	1
running	1
mates	1
without	1
consulting	1
the	1
leaders	1

Some	1
viewed	1
this	1
attempt	1
as	1
evidence	1
that	1
Mr.	1
Wagner	1
regarded	1
himself	1
as	1
bigger	1
than	1

party	1

the	1
Sept.	1

These	1
contend	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
serious	1
question	1
as	1
to	1
whether	1
Mr.	1
Wagner	1
has	1
the	1
confidence	1
of	1
the	1
Democratic	1
rank	1
and	1
file	1
in	1
the	1
city	1

view	1
is	1
that	1

prevent	1
confusion	1

are	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
ways	1

could	1
happen	1

the	1
churchmen	1
pointed	1
out	1

here	1
is	1
an	1
example	1
:	1
Last	1

in	1
Ghana	1
an	1
American	1
missionary	1
discovered	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
pay	1
his	1
hotel	1
bill	1
that	1
the	1
usual	1
rate	1
had	1
been	1
doubled	1

he	1
protested	1

the	1
hotel	1
owner	1
said	1

``	1

said	1

And	1
then	1
,	1
some	1
churchmen	1
remarked	1
,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
more	1
classical	1
church-state	1
problem	1
:	1
Can	1
religious	1
agencies	1
use	1
Government	1
funds	1
and	1
Peace	1
Corps	1
personnel	1
in	1
their	1
projects	1

still	1
preserve	1
the	1

eight-year	1
quest	1

call	1
the	1

predict	1
that	1

The	1
Gov.	1

administration	1
appears	1
to	1
face	1
a	1
difficult	1
year	1

the	1
governor's	1
theme	1
of	1
peace	1
and	1
harmony	1
subjected	1
to	1
severe	1
stresses	1

The	1
year	1
will	1
probably	1
start	1
out	1
with	1
segregation	1
still	1
the	1
most	1
troublesome	1
issue	1

But	1
it	1
might	1
give	1
way	1
shortly	1
to	1
another	1
vexing	1
issue	1

that	1
of	1
finances	1
in	1

The	1
transition	1
from	1
segregation	1
to	1
finances	1
might	1
already	1
be	1
in	1
progress	1
,	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
an	1
administration	1
proposal	1
to	1
hike	1
the	1
state	1
sales	1
tax	1
from	1
2	1
per	1
cent	1
to	1
3	1
per	1
cent	1
.	1
The	1
administration	1
has	1
said	1
the	1
sales	1
tax	1
proposal	1
is	1
merely	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
segregation	1
strategy	1
,	1
since	1
the	1
revenues	1
from	1
the	1
increase	1
would	1
be	1
dedicated	1
to	1
a	1
grant	1
in	1
aid	1
program	1
.	1
But	1
the	1
tardiness	1
of	1
the	1
administration	1
in	1
making	1
the	1
dedication	1
has	1
caused	1
legislators	1
to	1
suspect	1
the	1
tax	1
bill	1
was	1
related	1
more	1
directly	1
to	1
an	1
over-all	1
shortage	1
of	1
cash	1
than	1
to	1
segregation	1

Legislators	1
weary	1
Indeed	1
,	1
the	1
administration's	1
curious	1
position	1
on	1
the	1
sales	1
tax	1
was	1
a	1
major	1
factor	1
in	1
contributing	1
to	1
its	1
defeat	1
.	1
The	1
administration	1
could	1
not	1
say	1
why	1
$28	1
million	1
was	1
needed	1
for	1
a	1
grant-in-aid	1
program	1

The	1
effectiveness	1
of	1
the	1
governor	1
in	1
clearing	1
up	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
inconsistencies	1
revolving	1
about	1
the	1
sales	1
tax	1
bill	1
may	1
play	1
a	1
part	1
in	1
determining	1
whether	1
it	1
can	1
muster	1
the	1
required	1
two-thirds	1
vote	1

tax	1
bill	1
will	1
be	1
up	1
for	1
reconsideration	1
Wednesday	1
in	1
the	1
House	1
when	1
the	1
Legislature	1
reconvenes	1

Davis	1
may	1
use	1
the	1
tax	1
bill	1
as	1
a	1
means	1
to	1
effect	1
a	1
transition	1
from	1
special	1
sessions	1
of	1
the	1
Legislature	1
to	1
normalcy	1
.	1
If	1
it	1
fails	1
to	1
pass	1
,	1
he	1
can	1
throw	1
up	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
say	1
the	1
Legislature	1
would	1
not	1
support	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
efforts	1
to	1
prevent	1
integration	1

He	1
could	1
terminate	1
special	1
sessions	1
of	1
the	1
Legislature	1

Actually	1
,	1
Davis	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
toss	1
in	1
the	1
towel	1
soon	1
anyway	1
.	1
Many	1
legislators	1
are	1
already	1
weary	1
and	1
frustrated	1
over	1
the	1
so-far	1
losing	1
battle	1
to	1
block	1
token	1
integration	1
.	1
This	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
most	1
politicos	1
would	1
care	1
to	1
acknowledge	1
publicly	1
.	1
They	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
convey	1
the	1
notion	1
something	1
is	1
being	1
done	1
,	1
even	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
something	1
they	1
know	1
to	1
be	1
ineffectual	1
.	1
Underlying	1
concern	1
Passage	1
of	1
the	1
sales	1
tax	1
measure	1
would	1
also	1
give	1
Davis	1
the	1
means	1
to	1
effect	1
a	1
transition	1
.	1
He	1
could	1
tell	1
the	1
Legislature	1
they	1
had	1
provided	1
the	1
needed	1
funds	1
to	1
carry	1
on	1
the	1
battle	1
.	1
Then	1
he	1
could	1
tell	1
them	1
to	1
go	1
home	1
,	1
while	1
the	1
administration	1
continued	1
to	1
wage	1
the	1
battle	1
with	1
the	1
$28	1
million	1
in	1
extra	1
revenues	1
the	1
sales	1
tax	1
measure	1
would	1
bring	1
in	1
over	1
an	1
eight	1
months	1
period	1
.	1
It	1
is	1
difficult	1
to	1
be	1
certain	1
how	1
the	1
administration	1
views	1
that	1
$28	1
million	1
,	1
since	1
the	1
views	1
of	1
one	1
leader	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
the	1

as	1

the	1
administration	1
should	1
find	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
need	1
the	1
$28	1
million	1
for	1
a	1
grant-in-aid	1
program	1
,	1
a	1
not	1
unlikely	1
conclusion	1
,	1
it	1
could	1
very	1
well	1
seek	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
use	1
the	1
money	1
for	1
other	1
purposes	1
.	1
This	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
perfect	1
consonance	1
with	1
the	1
underlying	1
concern	1
in	1
the	1
administration	1
--	1
the	1
shortage	1
of	1
cash	1
.	1
It	1
could	1
become	1
an	1
acute	1
problem	1
in	1
the	1
coming	1
fiscal	1
year	1
.	1
If	1
the	1
administration	1
does	1
not	1
succeed	1
in	1
passing	1
the	1
sales	1
tax	1
bill	1
,	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
tax	1
bill	1
,	1
it	1
could	1
very	1
well	1
be	1
faced	1
this	1
spring	1
at	1
the	1
fiscal	1
session	1
of	1
the	1
Legislature	1
with	1
an	1
interesting	1
dilemma	1
.	1
Since	1
the	1
constitution	1
forbids	1
introduction	1
of	1
a	1
tax	1
bill	1
at	1
a	1
fiscal	1
session	1
,	1
the	1
administration	1
will	1
either	1
have	1
to	1
cut	1
down	1
expenses	1
or	1
inflate	1
its	1
estimates	1
of	1
anticipated	1
revenues	1
.	1
Constant	1
problem	1
In	1
either	1
case	1
,	1
it	1
could	1
call	1
a	1
special	1
session	1
of	1
the	1
Legislature	1
later	1
in	1
1961	1
to	1
make	1
another	1
stab	1
at	1
raising	1
additional	1
revenues	1
through	1
a	1
tax	1
raiser	1
.	1
The	1
prospect	1
of	1
cutting	1
back	1
spending	1
is	1
an	1
unpleasant	1
one	1
for	1
any	1
governor	1
.	1
It	1
is	1
one	1
that	1
most	1
try	1
to	1
avoid	1
,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
can	1
see	1
an	1
alternative	1
approach	1
to	1
the	1
problem	1
.	1
But	1
if	1
all	1
alternatives	1
should	1
be	1
clearly	1
blocked	1
off	1
,	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
expected	1
the	1
Davis	1
administration	1
will	1
take	1
steps	1
to	1
trim	1
spending	1
at	1
the	1
spring	1
session	1
of	1
the	1
state	1
Legislature	1
.	1
This	1
might	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
arouse	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
squeezed	1
out	1
by	1
the	1
trims	1
to	1
exert	1
pressure	1
on	1
the	1
Legislature	1
,	1
so	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
receptive	1
to	1
a	1
tax	1
proposal	1
later	1
in	1
the	1
year	1
.	1
A	1
constant	1
problem	1
confronting	1
Davis	1
on	1
any	1
proposals	1
for	1
new	1
taxes	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
charge	1
by	1
his	1
foes	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
tried	1
to	1
economize	1
.	1
Any	1
tax	1
bill	1
also	1
will	1
revive	1
allegations	1
that	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
followers	1
have	1
been	1
using	1
their	1
administration	1
affiliations	1
imprudently	1
to	1
profit	1
themselves	1
.	1
The	1
new	1
year	1
might	1
see	1
some	1
house-cleaning	1
,	1
either	1
genuine	1
or	1
token	1
,	1
depending	1
upon	1
developments	1
,	1
to	1
give	1
Davis	1
an	1
opportunity	1
to	1
combat	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
criticisms	1
